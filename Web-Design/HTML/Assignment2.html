      <h1>Camelids</h1>
      <p>
        The four llamas and camels are camelids Camelids tend to be large and
        are strictly herbivorous.Camelids differ from ruminants in sevral ways.
        They have a three- chambered rather than a four -chambered digestive
        tract,an upper lip that is spilt in two with each part seprately
        mobile;and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw.They have long legs
        that,because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,look
        longer still.(from Wikipedia)
